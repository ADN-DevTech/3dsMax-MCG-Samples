# 3ds Max 2017 MCG Samples

A library of useful Max Creation Graph (MCG) compounds and tools for 3ds Max 2017.

1. Download from: https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/3dsMax-MCG-Samples/archive/master.zip
2. Unzip to: %userprofile%\Autodesk\3ds Max 2017\Max Creation Graph\Tools
3. Restart 3ds Max.

Note that "%userprofile%" can be entered directly into Windows explorer and usually maps to somewhere  like "C:\Users\digginc\". We recommend that if you have installed previously you move the old "3dsMax-MCG-Samples" folder outside of the "Max Creation Graph\Tools" pathbefore unzipping.  

This process is documented in video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6qJNoEudaI

## Sample MCG Compounds

All sample compounds have the suffix "-ext". You can type into the search dialog "*-ext" to see a list of new operators. 

## Sample Scenes 

There are several sample max files included in the zip under the scenes folder that demonstrate the various tools.

## Notes

We recommend that you do not save modify the tools and compounds, but instead copy the files you want into a new directory and make the changes there.
